## Developing

Hydrogen Project is a collection of projects, but all of them are developed using Rust v1.85.0, we have
`rust-toolchain.toml` file to set the toolchain version, so you can use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install the
toolchain version.

Some projects have special requirements like `hydrogen` which needs an appropriate development environment, check the
`README.md` file in the project folder for more information.

## Using

If you are only interested in using Hydrogen, you can use the Docker image available
on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/nashiradeer/hydrogen-bot/pkgs/container/hydrogen-bot) and we have a
