## Developing

To develop Hydrogen, you need to have [Docker](https://docker.com) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed or any IDE that supports [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev). But before you enter the Dev Container, please first read the [development guide](dev/README.md) to understand how to configure the development environment.

## Using

Hydrogen is available on our [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/nashiradeer/hydrogen-bot/pkgs/container/hydrogen-bot), you can use it by running `docker run -e DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token -e LAVALINK=your_lavalink_host ghcr.io/nashiradeer/hydrogen-bot:0.0.1-alpha.11-alpine` in a terminal with [Docker](https://docker.com) installed and running, replacing `your_token` with your Discord bot token and `your_lavalink_host` with your Lavalink host. You can also use the Debian variant by replacing `ghcr.io/nashiradeer/hydrogen-bot:0.0.1-alpha.11-alpine` with `ghcr.io/nashiradeer/hydrogen-bot:0.0.1-alpha.11-debian`.

## Building

To build Hydrogen, you need to have [Docker](https://docker.com) (Podman not supported) installed and running on your machine and run `docker build -f Dockerfile.alpine -t hydrogen:latest .` in a terminal with [Docker](https://docker.com) installed and running, after the build is completed, you will have a Docker image ready for use, named "hydrogen:latest".

For the Debian variant, you can use `docker build -f Dockerfile.debian -t hydrogen:latest .` instead.
